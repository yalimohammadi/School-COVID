Metric to compare different strategies:
A) Infected
1) Number of infected people in first week.
2) Number of infected people in second week.
3) Number of infected people in third week.
4) Number of infected people in first month.
5) Number of infected people in second month.

6) Total infected throughout the entire process.


B) Tested isolated
1) Fraction of infected individuals that are tested.
2) Average time between infection and identification through testing.


C) Total school attendance
1) Average number of days school missed per student.
